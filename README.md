🌻 Automatic Detection of Sunflower Leaf Diseases
🧩 Problem Statement
In rural Egypt, many farmers struggle to identify the root cause of issues affecting their crops. Specifically:

They can't tell whether the problem is caused by a disease or a pest.

They find it difficult to accurately diagnose what's harming their plants.

And they often don’t know the appropriate treatment to apply.

As a result, crops like sunflowers may wither and die due to a lack of proper intervention at the right time.

❓ Why Not Just Hire an Agricultural Engineer?
That’s a fair question. You might say,
"Why don’t they just consult an agricultural expert?"

Well, the reality on the ground is a bit more complicated:

Most farmers in rural Egypt own only small plots of land.

Hiring an agricultural engineer is relatively expensive for them.

So, they can’t afford to get expert help on a regular basis.

👨‍🌾 While Agricultural Engineers Are Important…
Yes, agricultural experts play a key role in:

Diagnosing plant diseases accurately.

Recommending the most effective treatment.

Improving crop productivity.

But the real challenge is:
How can we deliver expert-level guidance to small-scale farmers in an affordable and accessible way?

💡 My Perspective as a Data Scientist
I’m not just observing the issue from afar—
As someone who lives in rural Egypt, I’ve seen this problem firsthand. It affects me, my community, and many farmers who grow sunflowers around us.

That’s why I’ve started collecting real-world data to help identify:

The type of disease affecting sunflower leaves.

The symptoms (e.g., color changes, spots, wilting).

And possible causes (e.g., soil type, humidity, insect activity).

🔰 Why Start With Sunflowers?
I chose sunflowers as the starting point because:

They are widely grown in many areas.

They are affected by a variety of visible diseases, which helps train and test the model.

Their symptoms are easy to capture visually, making data collection more effective.

🎯 Final Goal
Our ultimate goal is to build an intelligent tool (a mobile app or a website) that:

Detects plant diseases from an image of the sunflower leaf.

Recommends the appropriate treatment using a well-curated database.

Is simple and affordable enough for everyday farmers to use.
